HexToaster
==========

HexToaster, the hilariously out-of-date radix converter for OS X

Ancient code for a basic radix conversion utility for OS X. My very first Cocoa project, way back in 2004.
Updated for newer versions of XCode and SDKs.

Requires libgmp (setup for a default ports installation.)
